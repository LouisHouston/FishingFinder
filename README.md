# Fishing Finder

Live DEMO: https://fishing-finder.vercel.app/

Fishing Tracker is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to help anglers log, track, and share their fishing experiences. The platform allows users to mark water bodies, log catches, and view community fishing insights.

# Who is it for?

Anglers! I am also a fisherman and this is just a web app to communicate catches. The problem with other apps is that 1 Lake does not really help in terms of locating the correct fish but with spots you can really focus in on where exactly you caught and with what, for the non fishing people using the wrong lure/bait/hook can get your line stuck so logging those things are also important.

#### Thigns learned

Linkto for links but you really dont need links
NavigateTo via Code or redirect (but redirects are bad for components)
Hardcoding sucks always use envs when possible and keep the same formatting throughout the whole thing

# Suggestions
add optional photos for water bodies or catches? that might be additional db space

filtering by bait type and what is the most success depending on BoW and bait

analytics by let users track catch history by date or season that would be cool

add little bait shops on map not huge but helpful to users
